# Release Setup Complete ‚úÖ

The automated release workflow for Panel-UI has been successfully configured! Here's what's been set up:

## üöÄ What's Configured

### GitHub Actions Workflows

1. **`.github/workflows/release.yml`** - Automated semantic release
   - Triggers only on `packages/panel-ui/**` changes
   - Builds, tests, and publishes to npm
   - Creates GitHub releases with changelogs
   - Uses conventional commits for version determination

2. **`.github/workflows/ci.yml`** - Continuous integration
   - Runs on all pushes and PRs
   - Type checking, linting, testing, building
   - Validates both packages

### Semantic Release Configuration

- **`packages/panel-ui/.releaserc.json`** - Monorepo-aware semantic release
- **Conventional commits** for automatic versioning
- **Namespaced tags** (`panel-ui-v1.2.3`)
- **Automated changelogs** and GitHub releases

### Package Configuration

- **`packages/panel-ui/package.json`** - Properly configured for npm publishing
- **`packages/demo-app/package.json`** - Marked as private (won't be published)
- **Build artifacts** included in npm package (`dist/`, `README.md`, `LICENSE`)

## üìã Next Steps

### 1. Configure NPM Token (Required)

Follow the guide: [`docs/NPM_TOKEN_SETUP.md`](./NPM_TOKEN_SETUP.md)

1. Create npm access token (automation type)
2. Add `NPM_TOKEN` secret to GitHub repository settings
3. Verify the token has publish permissions

### 2. Test the Release Process

```bash
# Test locally (no publishing)
pnpm release:panel-ui:dry

# Make a test commit and push to main
git add .
git commit -m "feat: initial release setup"
git push origin main
```

### 3. Monitor First Release

- Check GitHub Actions for workflow execution
- Verify npm package publication
- Review generated GitHub release

## üéØ How Releases Work

### Automatic Releases

1. **Commit** with conventional format (`feat:`, `fix:`, etc.)
2. **Push to main** branch (or merge PR)
3. **GitHub Actions** triggers automatically
4. **Semantic release** analyzes commits
5. **Version determined** based on commit types
6. **Package built** and published to npm
7. **GitHub release** created with changelog

### Version Bumps

| Commit Type | Example | Version Bump |
|-------------|---------|--------------|
| `feat:` | `feat: add new panel type` | Minor (0.1.0) |
| `fix:` | `fix: resolve focus issue` | Patch (0.0.1) |
| `feat!:` | `feat!: remove deprecated API` | Major (1.0.0) |

### Monorepo Behavior

- Only `packages/panel-ui/**` changes trigger releases
- `packages/demo-app/**` changes are ignored
- Mixed commits work correctly (panel-ui changes count)

## üìÅ Files Created

### Workflows
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` - Automated release
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Continuous integration

### Documentation
- `docs/NPM_TOKEN_SETUP.md` - NPM token configuration
- `docs/RELEASE_PROCESS.md` - Complete release guide
- `docs/RELEASE_SETUP_COMPLETE.md` - This summary

### Package Files
- `packages/panel-ui/README.md` - Package documentation
- `packages/panel-ui/LICENSE` - MIT license

## üîß Commands Available

```bash
# Development
pnpm dev                    # Start demo app
pnpm build                  # Build panel-ui library
pnpm type-check            # Type check all packages

# Release testing
pnpm release:panel-ui:dry  # Test release (no publish)
pnpm release:panel-ui      # Manual release (use with caution)

# CI commands (used by GitHub Actions)
pnpm lint                  # Lint all packages
pnpm test                  # Run tests
pnpm build:demo           # Build demo app
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **NPM_TOKEN is required** - Releases will fail without it
2. **First release** will create the package on npm
3. **Conventional commits** are required for version bumps
4. **Demo app is private** - Will never be published to npm
5. **Releases are immediate** - No manual approval needed

## üéâ Ready to Release!

The release infrastructure is complete. Once you:
1. Configure the NPM_TOKEN secret
2. Make your first conventional commit
3. Push to main branch

Your package will be automatically published to npm! üöÄ
